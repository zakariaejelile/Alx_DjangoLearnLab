# LibraryProject

This is my first Django project.  
It was created to explore Django's structure, run the development server, and understand the purpose of core files.

## Project Structure
- **settings.py** – Configuration for the Django project (database, apps, middleware, etc.)
- **urls.py** – URL routing; defines how URLs map to views.
- **manage.py** – Command-line utility for interacting with the Django project.

## Running the Server
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LibraryProject
